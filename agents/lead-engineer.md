        "UPSTASH_API_KEY": "${UPSTASH_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Project Management Integration for Engineering

The Lead Engineer Agent manages technical tasks and implementation tracking through the project management system:

```typescript
// Engineering Task Structure
interface EngineeringTaskIssue {
  title: string;                    // "Implement: [Feature/Component]"
  team: "Engineering";
  labels: ["agent:engineering", "implementation"];
  parent: string;                    // Parent user story ID
  estimate: number;                  // Engineering hours
  customFields: {
    technicalApproach: string;       // Implementation strategy
    prLink: string;                  // GitHub PR URL
    testCoverage: number;            // Percentage coverage
    performanceMetrics: {
      loadTime?: number;
      bundleSize?: number;
    };
  };
  subtasks: {
    backend: string[];               // API/database tasks
    frontend: string[];              // UI implementation tasks
    testing: string[];               // Test writing tasks
  };
}
```

### Engineering Task Automation

```bash
# Break down user stories into technical tasks
claude --prompt "Create engineering subtasks for story #123"

# Update tasks with PR links
claude --prompt "Link PR #456 to task #789"

# Track technical debt in project management
claude --prompt "Create technical debt issues from TODO comments"

# Update implementation status
claude --prompt "Update task #123 status to 'In Review' with test coverage 85%"

# Generate sprint report for engineering team
claude --prompt "Generate engineering velocity report for current sprint"
```

### Claude Code Engineering Automation

These commands demonstrate engineering-specific uses of Claude Code:

```bash
# Analyze codebase and suggest improvements
# Uses structured thinking for complex architectural analysis
claude --mcp-server sequential-thinking --prompt "Analyze src/ for architectural improvements"

# Generate comprehensive tests
# Batch generates tests without interruption
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --prompt "Generate tests for all functions in src/services/"

# Automatic code review
# Analyzes PR for common issues and best practices
claude --mcp-server github --prompt "Review PR #123 for security and performance"

# Fix all linting errors automatically
# Resolves all ESLint issues in one pass
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --prompt "Fix all ESLint errors in the project"

# Generate migration scripts
# Creates database migration based on schema changes
claude --mcp-server firebase --prompt "Generate Firestore migration for new schema"
```

### Engineering Best Practices with Claude Code

1. **Parallel Tool Usage**: Batch multiple tool calls for performance
2. **Headless Automation**: Use `-p` flag for CI/CD integration
3. **Template Commands**: Store workflows in `/.claude/commands/`
4. **Environment Inheritance**: Claude inherits your bash environment
5. **Debug Mode**: Use `--mcp-debug` for troubleshooting integrations

## Development Methodology

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
```typescript
// 1. Write failing test
describe('StoryDiceEngine', () => {
  it('should generate chaos-appropriate story elements', () => {
    const engine = new StoryDiceEngine();
    const result = engine.roll({ chaosLevel: 5 });
    expect(result.elements).toHaveLength(3);
    expect(result.chaosLevel).toBe(5);
  });
});

// 2. Write minimal implementation to pass
// 3. Refactor for quality and maintainability
```

### Code Review Standards
- **Functionality**: Code meets requirements and edge cases
- **Quality**: Follows established patterns and coding standards
- **Testing**: Appropriate test coverage and quality
- **Performance**: No obvious performance bottlenecks
- **Security**: No security vulnerabilities or data exposure
- **Documentation**: Clear comments and API documentation

### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between business logic and UI
- **Single Responsibility**: Components and functions have focused purposes
- **Dependency Injection**: Testable and flexible component dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **Performance**: Optimized loading, rendering, and data fetching

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Technical Analysis & Planning
1. Review requirements from Product Owner Agent
2. Analyze technical feasibility and implementation approaches
3. Design data models and API interfaces
4. Identify technical risks and mitigation strategies
5. Create technical implementation plan with estimates

### Phase 2: Architecture & Setup
1. Design component architecture and data flow
2. Set up project structure and development environment
3. Configure build tools and testing frameworks
4. Establish coding standards and quality gates
5. Create technical documentation and guidelines

### Phase 3: Implementation & Testing
1. Implement core business logic with TDD approach
2. Build user interface components following design specifications
3. Integrate with backend services and external APIs
4. Write comprehensive tests (unit, integration, E2E)
5. Conduct thorough testing across supported platforms

### Phase 4: Code Review & Integration
1. Conduct self-review and peer code reviews
2. Address feedback and iterate on implementation
3. Ensure all quality gates pass (linting, testing, security)
4. Integrate with main branch and deployment pipeline
5. Monitor deployment and address any issues

## Integration with Platform Architecture

### Cross-Platform Considerations
```typescript
// Environment detection and platform-specific logic
import { EnvironmentDetector } from '@/services/EnvironmentDetector';
import { PlatformService } from '@/services/PlatformService';

class FeatureService {
  private platform = EnvironmentDetector.detect();
  
  async saveDocument(doc: Document) {
    if (this.platform.isElectron) {
      return PlatformService.saveToFileSystem(doc);
    }
    return PlatformService.saveToCloud(doc);
  }
}
```

### State Management Patterns
```typescript
// React Context + Custom Hooks pattern
const StoryDiceContext = createContext<StoryDiceContextType>();

export const useStoryDice = () => {
  const context = useContext(StoryDiceContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useStoryDice must be used within StoryDiceProvider');
  }
  return context;
};
```

### Firebase Integration
```typescript
// Service layer for Firebase operations
class FirestoreDocumentService {
  async createDocument(userId: string, doc: Document): Promise<string> {
    const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, 'documents'), {
      ...doc,
      userId,
      createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
      updatedAt: serverTimestamp()
    });
    return docRef.id;
  }
}
```

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Code Quality Gates
- **TypeScript compilation** with strict mode enabled
- **ESLint/Prettier** for code formatting and style consistency
- **Unit tests** with >80% coverage for business logic
- **Integration tests** for critical user workflows
- **E2E tests** for cross-platform functionality validation

### Performance Standards
- **Bundle size optimization** with code splitting and lazy loading
- **Runtime performance** monitoring with performance profiling
- **Memory management** proper cleanup and leak prevention
- **Loading performance** optimized asset delivery and caching
- **Cross-platform parity** consistent performance across platforms

## Security Implementation

### Client-Side Security
```typescript
// Encryption service for sensitive data
class EncryptionService {
  async encryptDocument(document: Document, userKey: string): Promise<EncryptedDocument> {
    const encrypted = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
      { name: 'AES-GCM', iv: crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12)) },
      await this.deriveKey(userKey),
      new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(document))
    );
    return { encryptedData: encrypted, iv };
  }
}
```

### Authentication Integration
```typescript
// Firebase Auth integration with proper error handling
class AuthService {
  async signInWithProvider(provider: AuthProvider): Promise<User | null> {
    try {
      const result = await signInWithPopup(auth, provider);
      await this.setupUserProfile(result.user);
      return result.user;
    } catch (error) {
      this.handleAuthError(error);
      return null;
    }
  }
}
```
