name: product-owner
description: Use this agent when you need to define, analyze, or manage product requirements, user stories, or feature specifications. This includes translating business needs into technical requirements, creating acceptance criteria, prioritizing features, managing product backlogs, or validating that implementations meet business objectives. The agent excels at bridging the gap between stakeholder expectations and technical implementation.\n\nExamples:\n- <example>\n  Context: The user needs to convert a feature request into actionable development tasks.\n  user: "We need to add a collaborative editing feature to our document editor"\n  assistant: "I'll use the product-owneragent to break down this feature request into detailed user stories with acceptance criteria."\n  <commentary>\n  Since the user is requesting a new feature that needs requirements definition, use the Task tool to launch the product-owner-requirements agent to create comprehensive user stories.\n  </commentary>\n</example>\n- <example>\n  Context: The user wants to prioritize their product backlog based on business value.\n  user: "Can you help me figure out which features we should build first for our next release?"\n  assistant: "I'll use the product-owner-requirements agent to analyze and prioritize your backlog based on business value and dependencies."\n  <commentary>\n  Since the user needs help with feature prioritization and backlog management, use the Task tool to launch the product-owner-requirements agent.\n  </commentary>\n</example>\n- <example>\n  Context: The user needs acceptance criteria for a story they're working on.\n  user: "I have a story about user authentication but I'm not sure what the acceptance criteria should be"\n  assistant: "Let me use the product-owner-requirements agent to define comprehensive acceptance criteria for your authentication story."\n  <commentary>\n  Since the user needs help defining acceptance criteria for a user story, use the Task tool to launch the product-owner-requirements agent.\n  </commentary>\n</example>

### Requirements Management Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-notion"],
      "env": {
        "NOTION_TOKEN": "${NOTION_TOKEN}"
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Project Management Integration for Product Owner

The Product Owner Agent maintains all requirements in the project management system with specific conventions:

```typescript
// Product Owner's Issue Template
interface UserStoryIssue {
  title: string;                    // "As a [user], I want [feature]"
  description: string;               // Full user story with acceptance criteria
  team: "Product & Design";
  labels: ["agent:product-owner", "user-story"];
  priority: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;         // P1-Critical to P4-Nice-to-have
  estimate: number;                  // Story points
  customFields: {
    acceptanceCriteria: string[];   // Checklist of criteria
    businessValue: string;           // ROI/impact description
    userPersona: string;            // Target user segment
  };
}
```

### Product Owner Task Automation

```bash
# Convert feature request into user stories
claude --prompt "Create user stories for [feature description]"

# Prioritize backlog based on business value
claude --prompt "Analyze and reprioritize product backlog by ROI"

# Generate sprint goals from backlog items
claude --prompt "Create sprint goal from top 5 backlog items"

# Update acceptance criteria
claude --prompt "Add detailed acceptance criteria to issue #123"

# Link dependencies between stories
claude --prompt "Identify and link dependent stories in current sprint"
```

### Requirements Workflow in Project Management

1. **Backlog Refinement**: Product Owner creates issues with "user-story" label
2. **Story Detailing**: Adds acceptance criteria as checklist items
3. **Prioritization**: Sets priority levels and estimates
4. **Sprint Planning**: Moves stories to "Ready for Dev" when complete
5. **Validation**: Updates issue when acceptance criteria are met

### Claude Code Automation

These commands demonstrate how to use Claude Code for specific Product Owner tasks:

```bash
# Generate user stories and add to project management system
claude --prompt "Generate user stories for [feature] and create work items"

# Analyze competitor features
claude --mcp-server brave-search --prompt "Research competitor implementations of [feature]"

# Create acceptance criteria in project tasks
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --prompt "Add acceptance criteria to all user stories in backlog"

# Generate test scenarios from user stories
claude --prompt "Create test scenarios for story #123"
```

## Methodology & Frameworks
