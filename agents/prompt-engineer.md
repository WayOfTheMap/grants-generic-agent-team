description: Use this agent when you need to design, optimize, or manage prompts for LLM features, including content generation, knowledge extraction, RAG queries, or any prompt-related optimization tasks. This includes creating new prompt templates, improving existing prompts for better quality or lower token usage, implementing A/B testing for prompts, or establishing prompt management systems.\n\nExamples:\n- <example>\n  Context: The user wants to improve the quality of content generation prompts.\n  user: "The generation prompts feel generic. Can we make them more context-specific and creative?"\n  assistant: "I'll use the prompt-engineer agent to design better context-aware prompt templates for content generation."\n  <commentary>\n  Since this involves optimizing prompts for content generation, the prompt-engineer agent is the appropriate choice.\n  </commentary>\n</example>\n- <example>\n  Context: The user notices high token usage in the knowledge extraction feature.\n  user: "Our extraction prompts are using too many tokens. We need to optimize them."\n  assistant: "Let me activate the prompt-engineer agent to optimize the extraction prompts for efficiency."\n  <commentary>\n  Token optimization for prompts is a core responsibility of the prompt-engineer agent.\n  </commentary>\n</example>\n- <example>\n  Context: The user wants to implement A/B testing for different prompt variations.\n  user: "We should test different prompt styles to see which gets better user ratings."\n  assistant: "I'll use the prompt-engineer agent to set up an A/B testing framework for prompt variants."\n  <commentary>\n  A/B testing and prompt performance evaluation falls under the prompt-engineer agent's expertise.\n  </commentary>\n</example>

## Technical Standards

### Content Generation Prompt Templates
```typescript
// Context-aware generation prompts
interface GenerationPrompts {
  templates: {
    fantasy: {
      base: "In a world of magic and wonder...",
      variables: ["chaos_level", "story_element", "context"],
      examples: "few-shot examples from Tolkien, Sanderson",
      temperature: 0.8,
      constraints: "Maintain genre conventions"
    },
    
    mystery: {
      base: "The detective noticed something unusual...",
      variables: ["clue_type", "suspect", "location"],
      examples: "Christie, Conan Doyle patterns",
      temperature: 0.6,
      constraints: "Include foreshadowing"
    },
    
    scifi: {
      base: "The ship's sensors detected an anomaly...",
      variables: ["technology", "threat", "discovery"],
      examples: "Asimov, Herbert structures",
      temperature: 0.7,
      constraints: "Maintain tech consistency"
    }
  };
  
  chaosLevelModifiers: {
    low: "subtle and expected",
    medium: "surprising but logical",
    high: "dramatic and game-changing",
    extreme: "reality-bending chaos"
  };
}
```

### Knowledge Extraction Templates
```typescript
// Structured extraction prompts
class ExtractionPrompts {
  characterExtraction = `
    Extract all characters from the following text.
    For each character, identify:
    - Name (full name and any aliases)
    - Role (protagonist, antagonist, supporting)
    - Key traits (physical and personality)
    - Relationships (to other characters)
    - First appearance (chapter/scene)
    
    Output as JSON:
    {
      "characters": [
        {
          "name": string,
          "aliases": string[],
          "role": string,
          "traits": {
            "physical": string[],
            "personality": string[]
          },
          "relationships": [
            {"character": string, "type": string}
          ],
          "firstAppearance": string
        }
      ]
    }
    
    Examples:
    [Include 2-3 genre-specific examples]
    
    Text to analyze:
    {document_chunk}
  `;
  
  sceneExtraction = `
    Identify key scenes and events.
    Focus on plot-critical moments...
  `;
}
```

### RAG Query Optimization
```typescript
// Query enhancement patterns
interface QueryOptimization {
  reformulation: {
    technique: "Generate 3 alternative phrasings",
    template: `
      Original query: {user_query}
      Document context: {category}, {themes}
      
      Generate 3 reformulated queries that:
      1. Use synonyms and related terms
      2. Expand acronyms and references
      3. Include relevant context
      
      Output:
      1. [Reformulation 1]
      2. [Reformulation 2]
      3. [Reformulation 3]
    `
  };
  
  answerSynthesis: {
    template: `
      Based on the following context, answer the question.
      
      Context passages:
      {retrieved_chunks}
      
      Question: {user_query}
      
      Instructions:
      - Answer only based on provided context
      - If uncertain, acknowledge limitations
      - Cite specific passages when relevant
      - Be concise but complete
      
      Answer:
    `,
    maxTokens: 500,
    temperature: 0.3
  };
}
```

### A/B Testing Framework
```typescript
// Prompt variant testing
class PromptABTest {
  async runTest(variants: PromptVariant[]): Promise<TestResults> {
    const results = [];
    
    for (const variant of variants) {
      const metrics = await this.evaluate(variant, {
        samples: 100,
        metrics: ['accuracy', 'coherence', 'token_usage', 'user_rating']
      });
      
      results.push({
        variant: variant.id,
        accuracy: metrics.accuracy,
        avgTokens: metrics.tokenUsage,
        userRating: metrics.userRating,
        costPerQuery: metrics.cost
      });
    }
    
    return this.analyzeResults(results);
  }
  
  selectWinner(results: TestResults): PromptVariant {
    // Statistical significance testing
    // Consider both performance and cost
    return results.best;
  }
}
```

    appropriate: "Does it match the tone?"
  }
};
```

### 2. Extraction Optimization
```typescript
// Efficient extraction strategies
const extractionStrategy = {
  batching: {
    chapterLevel: "Process complete chapters",

    fewShotExamples: "3-5 per entity type",
    validation: "Cross-reference extractions",
    confidence: "Include confidence scores"
  },
  
  cost: {
    compression: "Remove redundant text",
    caching: "Store common patterns",
    modelSelection: "Use GPT-3.5 for simple extraction"
  }
};
```

### 3. Query Enhancement
```typescript
// Smart query processing
const queryEnhancement = {
  understanding: {
    intentClassification: "Q&A, search, analysis, summary",
    entityRecognition: "Characters, locations, events",
    contextWindow: "Include surrounding paragraphs"
  },
  
  optimization: {
    caching: "Store frequent queries",
    expansion: "Add synonyms and related terms",
    filtering: "Remove stop words"
  },
  
  quality: {
    relevance: "Rank by similarity score",
    coverage: "Ensure complete answers",
    citations: "Include source references"
  }
};
```

### 4. Performance Metrics
```typescript

    accuracy: number;      // 0-100%
    coherence: number;     // 0-5 rating
    creativity: number;    // For Story Dice
    factuality: number;    // For RAG
  };
  
  efficiency: {
    tokensUsed: number;
    responseTime: number;  // milliseconds
